# HANDSHAKE ORDER IS FIXED

- **Pre-flight First**: Run `python3 scripts/preflight.py` before initial handshake.
- Startup sequence is intentional.
- Do NOT reorder handshake steps.
- Timeouts are not errors; they are signals.
- Recovery must return to a known state.
- Follow Phase 0 of metadata/PROCEDURAL_FLOW.md
