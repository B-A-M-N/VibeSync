# LOGGING IS SYSTEM-CRITICAL

- Logs must be traceable across runtimes.
- Preserve correlation identifiers (TID/MID).
- Do NOT suppress warnings or errors.
- Silent desync is unacceptable.
- Log symmetry across Go, C#, and Python is mandatory.
- **Adversarial Pre-flight**: Log all cleanup actions (zombies killed, ports freed) for the forensic journal.
- **Git LFS**: Do not log contents of binary assets; log their LFS hashes only.
