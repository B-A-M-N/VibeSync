# PROTOCOL IS CONTRACT

- Message formats are immutable.
- Do NOT rename fields or reorder payloads.
- Protocol changes require version bumps.
- Assume both sides may be running different versions.
- Reference: BRIDGE_CONTRACT.md
- **Adversarial Pre-flight**: Run `python3 scripts/preflight.py` to resolve network/port blocks.
- **Git LFS**: Protocol payloads should never contain raw binary asset data; use LFS pointers or UUIDs.
