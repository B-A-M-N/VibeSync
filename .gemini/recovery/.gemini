# FAILURE IS EXPECTED

- **Automated Cleanup**: Run `python3 scripts/preflight.py` immediately after an engine crash or port block.
- Unity or Blender may restart independently.
- Partial connectivity is normal.
- Do NOT propagate failure across boundaries.
- Recovery must be localized and reversible.
- Consult FAILURE_MODES.md for recovery paths.
