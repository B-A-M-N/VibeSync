# STATE AUTHORITY RULES

- State has a single owner at any moment.
- Do NOT merge state heuristically.
- Conflicts must be surfaced, not hidden.
- Rollback is preferable to corruption.
- Follow absolute invariants in metadata/PROCEDURAL_FLOW.md
- **Adversarial Pre-flight**: Run `python3 scripts/preflight.py` to clear state locks or zombie processes.
- **Git LFS**: State files should reference LFS-tracked assets by hash or UUID, never raw content.
