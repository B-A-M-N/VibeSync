# SYNC LOOP CONSTRAINTS

- Loop cadence is deliberate.
- Do NOT increase frequency without instruction.
- Backpressure must propagate upstream.
- Dropped frames are safer than desync.
- Adhere to metadata/FREEZE_PROOF_GUIDE.md
- **Adversarial Pre-flight**: Run `python3 scripts/preflight.py` if the sync loop hangs or desyncs.
- **Git LFS**: Do not attempt to read binary assets inside the loop.
