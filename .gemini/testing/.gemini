# TEST UNDER FAILURE

- Assume slow, missing, or malformed messages.
- Test disconnects and mid-stream restarts.
- Happy-path-only testing is invalid.
- Use Golden Set Regression Testing for all new thresholds.
- **Adversarial Pre-flight**: Tests should verify that the environment is pre-cleaned before execution.
- **Git LFS**: Testing must handle LFS-tracked assets (mocked or present) without direct binary parsing.
