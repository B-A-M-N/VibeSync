# Goose Context: VibeSync Distributed Kernel

## 🏛️ Security & Forensic Protocol
- **Ledger**: Every mutation is cryptographically chained in the WAL. No tool call without technical rationale.
- **Veto**: If engine state is `VETOED` or `PANIC`, you are mechanically locked.

## 🛡️ Resilient Sync Workflow
1. **Discover**: `get_diagnostics` -> Verify cluster health and existing mappings.
2. **Targeting**: Use UUIDs for precise state and `sem:RoleName` for functional intent.
3. **Iron Box**: Every mutation MUST be atomic. Use `begin_atomic_operation`.
4. **Multiplex**: Use `vibe_multiplex` for complex Unity ↔ Blender coordination.

## 🧪 Cynical Self-Verification
Before executing any mutation, perform a cynical technical validation:
*Identify 3 ways this could fail based on the **Edge Case Checklist** in `metadata/AI_WORKFLOW.md`.*

## 📁 Storage
- Local state persists in `.vibesync/`.
- `HUMAN_ONLY/` is mechanically invisible. Do not touch.
