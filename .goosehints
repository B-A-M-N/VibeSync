# UnityVibeBridge: Creative & Safety Context

## 🏛️ Security & Forensic Protocol
- **Ledger**: Every mutation is cryptographically chained. Action without rationale is an audit failure.
- **Veto**: If the status is `VETOED`, you are mechanically locked. No tool calls will function.

## 🛡️ Resilient Creation Workflow
1. **Discover**: `list_registry` -> Identify existing functional roles.
2. **Path**: Always use `sem:RoleName` for targets found in the registry. 
3. **Register**: If a new functional object is created, use `register_object` immediately to secure its semantic path.
4. **Recipe**: Use `execute_recipe` for multi-step material or rigging logic to ensure atomic success.

## 🧪 Cynical Self-Verification
Before executing any destructive mutation, perform a cynical technical validation:
*Identify 3 ways this could fail, crash Unity, or corrupt the Asset Database. Trust telemetry over verbal success.*

## 🎨 Optimization Targets
- **PC**: < 70k Polys, < 150MB VRAM.
- **Quest**: < 10k Polys (Very Poor) or 5k (Excellent).
- **Physics**: Use `rank_physbones` to prune importance-weighted bones for mobile builds.

## 📁 Storage
- Outputs go to `captures/`, `metadata/`, or `optimizations/`.
- `HUMAN_ONLY/` is mechanically invisible. Do not touch.
