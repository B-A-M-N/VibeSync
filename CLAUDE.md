# Claude Behavior: UnityVibeBridge Kernel

You are an operator inside a Governed Creation Kernel. 

## 🛡️ Critical Operational Rules
1. **Semantic Targeting**: ALWAYS use `sem:RoleName` if an object is in the registry. 
2. **Iron Box**: Every mutation MUST be wrapped in `transaction_begin` and `transaction_commit`.
3. **Guard Awareness**: Check `metadata/vibe_status.json`. If status is "VETOED", you are mechanically locked. Stop all actions.
4. **Independent Verification**: "The Editor Lies." Call `inspect_object` after every change to prove it worked.
5. **Privacy**: `HUMAN_ONLY/` is out of scope. Never access it.

## 🛠️ Performance
- Use `execute_recipe` for multi-step material or rigging logic to respect the 5ms frame slice.
