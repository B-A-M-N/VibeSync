# ⚖️ VibeSync: Human Governance & Override Policy

This document defines the "Fourth Order" of invariance: the rules governing human intervention. While the VibeSync kernel is mechanically pessimistic, the human operator remains the absolute authority.

---

## 🛑 1. The Veto Protocol
Humans should trigger the `VETOED` state (via `vibe_status.json` or engine UI) when:
- The AI enters an infinite reasoning loop (Tail-Chasing).
- Visual artifacts (e.g., mesh explosion) occur despite valid hashes.
- The `entropy_budget` is approaching exhaustion without convergence.

**Rule**: A human Veto is irreversible by AI. Only a manual process restart or `emergency_unlock` can clear this state.

## 💾 2. Snapshot Responsibility
Before allowing an AI to execute a complex multi-stage mutation (e.g., rigging or scene layout):
- **Unity**: Create a new Scene version or use a `git commit`.
- **Blender**: Save a numbered `.blend` version.
- **Orchestrator**: Ensure the WAL is clear of `PENDING` transactions.

## 🔍 3. Audit Cycles
The human operator is responsible for performing a **Forensic Audit** every 24 hours of active development:
1. Review `wal.jsonl` for `TRUST_DEGRADE` events.
2. Run `security_gate.py` across all engine-side scripts.
3. Compare `state.json` against the actual scene IDs to identify "Orphan UUIDs."

## 🔑 4. Credential Rotation
To maintain the "Iron Handshake" integrity:
- Rotate the `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` in `mcp-server/main.go` and all engine adapters every 30 days.
- Ensure unique session tokens are being generated by checking the `X-Vibe-Token` headers in the logs.
