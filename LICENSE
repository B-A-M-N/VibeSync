# VibeSync: Dual-License & Operation-Credit Agreement (v1.2)

Copyright (C) 2026 B-A-M-N (The "Author")

This project is distributed under a **Dual-Licensing Model** incorporating an **Open-Core with Remote Execution** framework. By using this software, you agree to be bound by the terms described below.

---

## 1. THE OPEN-SOURCE PATH: GNU AGPLv3
For non-commercial use, hobbyists, and open-source contributors.

The core bridging logic of VibeSync is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3) as published by the Free Software Foundation. 

**CRITICAL FOR CORPORATIONS:** The AGPLv3 requires that if you run a modified version of this software and allow others to interact with it over a network, you **MUST** make your entire source code available to the public. If you cannot or will not share your source code, you **MAY NOT** use this license and **MUST** pursue the Commercial Path below.

---

## 2. THE COMMERCIAL PATH: "WORK-OR-PAY" MODEL
For entities generating revenue, commercial studios, or those who wish to keep their modifications private.

To use VibeSync commercially without being subject to the AGPLv3 source-sharing requirements, you must satisfy **ONE** of the following:

### A. Maintenance Contribution (Manpower)
Documented and verified "Significant Maintenance Contributions" to the project (Code, Documentation, Infrastructure).
### B. Commercial License Fee (Money)
Payment of the stipulated commercial license fee.
### C. Explicit Discretionary Waiver
A written waiver granted by the Author at their sole discretion.

## 3. OPEN-CORE, REMOTE OPERATION CREDITS & EARLY ACCESS
VibeSync employs an **Open-Core** model where basic synchronization is unrestricted. Advanced "Complex Operations" are intended to be gated via the Go-based Orchestrator.

**EARLY ACCESS PERIOD**: During the v0.x development phase, **ALL** features (including Complex and Vision tiers) are provided at **Zero Cost** to encourage community testing and feedback. 

**TRANSITION POLICY**: Upon the release of v1.0, the Author reserves the right to activate the **Credit-Gate** for high-compute or AI-driven operations as defined in the project's Monetization Matrix. Notice of transition will be provided at least 30 days prior to enforcement.

| Operation Tier | Cost (Early Access) | Final Tier (v1.0+) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Sync** | **Free** | **Free** |
| **Complex Sync** | **Free** | **Credits Required** |
| **Vision Tools** | **Free** | **Credits Required** |

**SERVICE COMPLIANCE**: Access to Remote/Cloud operations is provided as a service. In accordance with Section 13 of the AGPLv3, the Author reserves the right to charge for access to these networked services even when the client-side bridge code is open source.

---

## 4. CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT (CLA) & PROVENANCE
By contributing code, documentation, or assets to this project, you hereby grant the Author a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, and **sublicense** your contributions in both the open-source and commercial versions of the software.

**TRACKING WAIVER**: This grant is made without the requirement for the Author to track, notify, or seek further approval from the Contributor for any future use, including incorporation into proprietary or paid "Remote Execution" services. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant this license and that your contributions do not violate any third-party rights.

## 5. LIABILITY LIMITATION, INDEMNITY & AI DISCLAIMER

1. **NO WARRANTY**: Software provided "AS IS." The Author is not responsible for the non-deterministic nature of AI-interpreted operations.
2. **AI NON-DETERMINISM**: The Author is not liable for "hallucination drift," unintended asset deletion, or project corruption resulting from LLM-to-Editor translations.
3. **HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP MANDATE**: All AI-suggested mutations are "Proposed" until a Human User executes a "Finalize" check. THE USER ACCEPTS FULL LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CODE EXECUTED.
4. **INDEMNIFICATION**: You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Author from all claims arising from your use of the software or your breach of this license.
5. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR "VIBE").

## 6. THIRD-PARTY IP & EULA COMPLIANCE

1. **NON-AFFILIATION**: VibeSync is an independent project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by** Unity Technologies, the Blender Foundation, or any other third-party engine provider.
2. **USER RESPONSIBILITY**: Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use of VibeSync complies with the End User License Agreements (EULA) and Terms of Service of Unity, Blender, and any assets used within those engines. 
3. **NO BYPASS**: VibeSync is not intended to bypass, circumvent, or violate any technical protections or licensing restrictions of the connected creative engines.

### Preamble
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure that for software modified and run on a server, the source code of that modified version is made available to the community.

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
