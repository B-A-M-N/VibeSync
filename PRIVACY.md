# Privacy Policy (v0.4 Preview)

VibeSync is designed as a **Local-First Orchestration System**. We prioritize your privacy and the security of your creative intellectual property.

## 1. Data Collection
VibeSync **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personally identifiable information (PII), scene data, or telemetry to any external servers or third parties.

## 2. Local State Persistence
All data generated by VibeSync, including:
- Write-Ahead Logs (WAL)
- Event Journals
- Engine State Snapshots
- Session Tokens

...is stored exclusively on your local machine within the `.vibesync/` directory of your project and the project's temporary directory.

## 3. Network Communication
The Go Orchestrator communicates with Unity and Blender via **local loopback only** (localhost). No inbound or outbound network connections to the wider internet are initiated by the core VibeSync system.

## 4. Third-Party Adapters
VibeSync acts as a bridge between Unity and Blender. This Privacy Policy does not cover data collection performed by those engines or other third-party plugins you may have installed.

## 5. Future Changes
If future versions (v1.0+) introduce cloud-integrated features (e.g., remote rendering or centralized credit management), this policy will be updated, and such features will require explicit user opt-in.
