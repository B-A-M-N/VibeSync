# 🧠 VibeSync: Third-Order Invariants (Epistemic Layer)

This document defines the constraints on **belief formation** within the VibeSync ecosystem. These rules prevent systemic self-deception, protocol erosion, and long-horizon drift in AI-mediated workflows.

---

## 1. Belief Provenance Invariance
- **Axiom**: No belief is valid without a verifiable origin.
- **Enforcement**: Every derived conclusion (e.g., "Unity compilation deadlock fixed") must reference specific WAL entries or error hashes.
- **Rule**: Beliefs without provenance decay immediately.

## 2. Confidence Decay Invariance
- **Axiom**: Confidence expires unless continuously re-validated.
- **Enforcement**: System confidence in specific paths carries a "half-life." 
- **Rule**: If a path is not re-observed within 12 operations, its confidence trends toward zero.

## 3. Counterfactual Pressure Invariance
- **Axiom**: Every stable belief must survive a counterfactual.
- **Enforcement**: The system periodically identifies triggers that would falsify a belief. 
- **Rule**: If a falsification trigger fires, the belief is invalidated automatically with no AI discretion.

## 4. Success Blindness Invariance
- **Axiom**: Success does not update beliefs unless evidence changed.
- **Enforcement**: Successful operations do not inherently increase confidence; only new, unique observations do.
- **Rule**: Prevent "it worked once, so it's permanently right" fallacies.

## 5. Drift Budget Invariance
- **Axiom**: Deviation from protocol is a consumable resource.
- **Enforcement**: The Orchestrator tracks `allowed_deviations`. 
- **Rule**: Once the drift budget is exhausted, AI is locked, and manual human remediation is required.

## 6. Narrative Suppression Invariance
- **Axiom**: Narratives are non-authoritative.
- **Enforcement**: Explanations and "stories" generated by AI must be stored separately from technical facts.
- **Rule**: Facts must never reference narratives; state changes can only be triggered by facts.

## 7. Observer Relativity Invariance
- **Axiom**: No belief is valid unless observable from ≥2 independent layers.
- **Enforcement**: Facts require a "double witness" (e.g., Blender + Bridge or WAL + Engine).
- **Rule**: Single-observer facts are marked as `UNCONFIRMED`.

## 8. Long-Horizon Amnesia Invariance
- **Axiom**: Lessons learned expire unless re-earned.
- **Enforcement**: Lessons (e.g., "Script X causes hang") carry explicit expiry dates.
- **Rule**: No "eternal wisdom" is permitted; the system must remain capable of re-testing assumptions.
